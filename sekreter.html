            The secretarybird or secretary bird (Sagittarius serpentarius) 
            is a large, mostly terrestrial bird of prey. Endemic to Africa,
            it is usually found in the open grasslands and savanna of the 
            sub-Saharan region. John Frederick Miller described the species 
            in 1779. A member of the order Accipitriformes, which also includes
             many other diurnal birds of prey such as eagles, hawks, kites, 
             vultures, and harriers, it is placed in its own family, Sagittariidae.
