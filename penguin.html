            The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), also known as Cape
             penguin or South African penguin, is a species of penguin
              confined to southern African waters. Like all penguins, it is
               flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and 
               flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. Adults weigh an 
               average of 2.2–3.5 kg (4.9–7.7 lb) and are 60–70 cm (24–28 in) tall.
                The species has distinctive pink patches of skin above the eyes and 
                a black facial mask. The body's upper parts are black and sharply delineated
                 from the white underparts, which are spotted and marked with a black band.
