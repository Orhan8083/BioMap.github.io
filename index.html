        <h3> Introduction </h3>
        <p> You will come across a information part bellow here, and if you go
            further down, you'll come across a interactive map which you can 
            visually see the parameters that affect biodiversity.</p>

        <h3> Information: </h3>
        <p> In this interactive site, you can see the Biodiversity parameters in South Africa.
        The formation of biological diversity in south africa according to temperature change
        is closly related to how different plant and animal species have adaptod to the various
        temperature ranges that are present across the region . South Africa's climate is characterized 
        a wide range of temperatures ranging from hot and humid conditions in the east to arid and semi-arid 
        environments in the west and north. in the eastren regions where temperatures are high ,various tress 
        and dense forests thrive,as well as a wide range of animals,including reptiles and mammals. the high
        temperatures conditions support the growth of rare plant species that provide habitats for different 
        animal species. on the other hand ,in the country's western regions , the hot and dry desert climate
        has encouraged the growth of unique plant species that have develpped mechanism to adapt to the extreme
        heat and drought. South africa's unique and diverse climate conditions have facilitated the evolution of 
        various plant and animal species, making it one of the richest regions in the world in terms of biodiversity.
        Therefore,preserving and managing the natural habitats is critical in ensuring that the unique biological diversity in
        the region is maintained for both ecological and economic reasons.

        <h3> Map </h3>
        <p> Here is an interactive map of South African Republic. 
            You can interact with it to see different parameters 
            visually:
            (Notes: In the temperature map, the color that is closer to red indicates that it has a higher temprature.
            The climate map legend is bellow.)
